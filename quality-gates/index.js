//Given a total due and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket, determine whether you can pay for the item. Change will always be represented in the following order: 50p, 20p, 10p, 1p. 
//To illustrate: changeEnough([5, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should yield true, since having 5 50p, 20 20p, 5 10p and 0 pennies gives you 2.5+ 4 + .50 + 0 = 7.00.
